                    H_art the band is a super talented band made of three versatile artists Mordecai Kimeu, Wachira Gatama, and Kenneth Muya.  
                    The band is well known for how they interact with a wide variety of musical instruments, their musical poetic rhymes with smooth, 
                    danceable tunes and futuristic dress code. They have worked enough to roar their band products in Kenya and East Africa.

                    The band was formed when the three gentlemen met in their acting career at the Kenya National Theatre in late 2012. This was after they 
                    learned that they share a similar passion for music. They later joined Penya Africa’s prestigious artist development program at 
                    Sauti Academy where they learned more about music from writing, recording, music business. They graduated in April 2014; following a 
                    year of hard work, determination, perseverance, and performing at almost every venue and street corner in Nairobi, Kenya thus 
                    building an ever-growing steady reputation and prominence with various audiences.

                </p> 
                <p>
                    The band is defined by African cultured theme which is observed from their dress code all through to their music. Their music speaks 
                    to generations from young to old since it is inspired by day-to-day experiences. Mordecai and Wachira have flourish delivery in African 
                    poetry while Kenneth compliments their rhymes with smooth African tunes. Mordecai also beautifies their jams with his heavenly vocals, 
                    thus creating a fresh genre they like to call Afro Poetry.
